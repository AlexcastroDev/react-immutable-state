# Deep Dive in React Immutable State

## Description

This project focuses on exploring the concept of immutable objects and classes in the context of React applications. By utilizing technologies such as `useState`, `context`, `use-immer`, and `zustand`, the aim is to gain a better understanding of rendering and re-rendering processes.

One of the challenges addressed in this project is the potential inefficiency caused by re-rendering an entire list instead of just updating a single item. By carefully examining the behaviors of the aforementioned tools, we can mitigate unnecessary re-renders and optimize the performance of our React components.

## Technologies Used

-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   `useState`: A React hook used for managing state within functional components.
-   `context`: A feature in React that provides a way to share data between components without explicitly passing it through props.
-   `use-immer`: A custom hook that simplifies working with immutable state by leveraging the Immer library.
-   `zustand`: A small, fast state management library for React that provides a simple and flexible API.

## Goals

The main goals of this project are:

1. Gain a deeper understanding of immutable objects and classes.
2. Explore the behavior of React's `useState` hook and its impact on rendering and re-rendering.
3. Understand the usage of `context` in managing shared data between components.
4. Evaluate the benefits of using `use-immer` for working with immutable state.
5. Investigate the capabilities of `zustand` as an alternative state management solution.
